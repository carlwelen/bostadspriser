# Handoff: continuing the hardening loop

## Current checkpoint (2026-10-25, single-orchestrator resumption)

- Live integration checkpoint: 0de29a4 -> 7ead977, full gate green. Remaining approved queue: 671722a, c396c2c, 9d670ed, 681cb6b, 492fdc0, b2e1923, 8a666a6, d9fcd9c, 69e3f2d, 1b3c70e, 4825985, 0885683, 20daae3, 00647b0. F20 original4257179 and test12d76ea are folded into fe86f8b to keep each merge green; skip both originals. See backlog for active reviews and later follow-ups.

This checkpoint supersedes historical state below. Read `docs/backlog.md` and verify Git/process state before acting.

- The user resumed repository coding, but requested that only this assistant work on the project. All sub-agents are stopped. Do not spawn/resume agents. Do not use browser/computer UI control or change GitHub settings without explicit approval; latest instruction is to leave settings untouched. Repository commands, tests and coding remain authorized.
- Git identity was corrected to Carl Welén <72322644+carlwelen@users.noreply.github.com> in global and repository configuration. The old placeholder numeric ID12345678 belongs to shubh2294 and explains the erroneous attribution. SSH authenticates as carlwelen; GitHub showed zero collaborators and no deploy keys. Published history was not rewritten.
- Cursor and Lovable remain installed. Before the user prohibited further settings changes, temp was removed from both apps while preserving their access to14 other existing repositories. Both saves were confirmed. The user subsequently chose to leave settings untouched: do not restore, remove or alter access without new explicit approval.
- Main code checkpoint94b17b8 is F37 sourcea374e52. Its resumed full gate passed (310 browser/800 pytest), log /tmp/hardening-resume-main-gate.log, TEST_DB_NAME=bostadspriser_test_a E2E_PORT=3100. F36 source7f21875 ->8106ac4 is green. Latest verified published main7724920; main is three commits ahead before the new ledger checkpoint.
- Remaining approved integration order after F37:0de29a4,671722a,c396c2c,9d670ed,681cb6b,492fdc0,b2e1923,8a666a6,d9fcd9c,69e3f2d,1b3c70e,4825985,0885683,20daae3,00647b0. Use scripts/merge-seq.sh with full gate and backlog updates after each. Existing independent approvals are recorded in docs/review-probes. Publish only complete green groups through the authorized Git remote; no UI control is needed.
- Original wrapper15 remains stopped. Root resumed the reviewed queue with /tmp/hardening-integrate-single.py (PID20324), log /tmp/hardening-integration-single.log, test_a/3100. /tmp/hardening-integration-stop was cleared after explicit user resumption; /tmp/hardening-publish-hold remains present. The root-owned caffeinate process was stopped. Do not blindly restart an old wrapper or remove flags without verifying current state.
- Candidate2 is immutable preparation60e547d2800a24e43c16560f6f01a18a9313c6e7 on integration/audit-candidate-2, /tmp/bostadspriser-audit-candidate-2. It contains every approved queued task and passed568Vitest/372browser/894pytest. It was pushed and verified. Never merge its preparation commit to main.
- Whole audit1 completed with0P0/2P1/6P2. Audit2 was interrupted after confirmed new B64(P1), B65/B66/B67/F48(P2); clean P0/P1 streak remains0. Its original gate passed, while eight independent Python probes reproduce failures. See docs/review-probes/whole-audit-2-interrupted.md. No final audit2 coverage claim is made.
- B64 implementation: root-owned /tmp/bostadspriser-hardening-b-malformed, branchhardening/b-malformed-payload, base60e547d, test_b64/3102. Fifty failing-first regressions plus42 controls were reproduced before fixing the shared payload decoder. Full gate/commit/review remain.
- F48 source worktree /tmp/bostadspriser-hardening-e-tooltip is clean at60e547d; interrupted before implementation. Reviewer scratch /tmp/review-whole-audit-2 and evidence /tmp/r-whole-audit-2 are preserved. Implement new findings one task per isolated-worktree commit after failing-first tests and a full green gate. Same-context root review is not a fresh independent review; the original fresh-review requirement is recorded as an owner decision under the current no-sub-agent instruction.
- Do not cherry-pick preparation1426915,3a2494a,16b4629,96bcc91,f987cf7,f125002,512d50e,c896c75,582efba,f8c63d8,60e547d. Folded originals4257179+12d76ea ->fe86f8b; acd9acb ->991a460;5363f4b ->a374e52;7b5e461 ->681cb6b;d65f6b2+b5027dd ->8a666a6. Skip F45 dependency commits66ce1b1/6d39305. c396c2c/9d670ed are actual reviewed docs tasks.
- Stop conditions remain: all unblocked mandatory P1/P2 complete and reviewed, two consecutive fresh audits without new P0/P1, final code matching the audited candidate, docs/REPORT.md, final green gate and verified push. /tmp/REPORT.hardening-draft.md is only a draft. B16 storage terms remain BLOCKED: needs owner decision. P3 optional. Never touch protected files, live providers or the dev DB.

Written 2026-10-23 when the Claude Code orchestrator ran out of budget. Read this first, then `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/backlog.md`.

## 0. Starting Codex

`scripts/start-codex.sh` starts an interactive session; add `--exec` for a non-interactive run. The orchestrator and reviewers use `gpt-6-astra` with high reasoning; implementer sub-agents use `gpt-6.1-sol`. The script sets a workspace-write sandbox with network access for localhost Postgres and e2e. If tests fail on sandbox permissions, use `SANDBOX=danger-full-access scripts/start-codex.sh`.

## 1. Where things stand

- **`main` is green.** `scripts/check.sh` passed after every merge. That covers typecheck, lint with 0 warnings, vitest unit + integration, the production build, Playwright e2e on desktop + Pixel 7, ruff and pytest.
- **All P0 items are done.** P1 is mostly done or waiting to be merged. P2/P3 are partly done. See `docs/backlog.md` for the per-item status, shas and notes.
- **No audit round has run yet.** The stop condition needs two consecutive clean ones (§5).
- **Open owner decision:** the Mapbox geocoding storage terms. See "Owner decisions" in `docs/backlog.md`.

## 2. Unmerged work waiting on branches

> **Update at the end of the Claude session:** §2a's B46 and B16 review 4 commits, and **all of §2b**, are now **merged on `main`**, with the gate green after each. **Still unmerged:** `d0e24c6` (B13 matcher, changes requested, see below) and **all of §2c**. The E batch was reviewed: 8 of 11 commits are approved, and F20, F11/F12 and F28 need fixes. See `docs/review-probes/e-batch-review.md`. Always confirm with `git cherry -v main <branch>`.

Each block below is a branch with commits that are **not on `main` yet**. Merge each block in the order shown, **oldest commit first**, using `scripts/merge-seq.sh <sha> <sha> …`. The script cherry-picks one commit at a time and runs the full gate after each. List what is still unmerged with `git cherry -v main <branch>` (lines starting with `+`).

### 2a. `handoff/b-scraper`: merge FIRST

`bf9588f 3854f27 d02d789 c2ed80f d0e24c6`

| sha | Item | Review state when handed off |
|---|---|---|
| `bf9588f`, `3854f27`, `d02d789` | **B46**: the scraper calls `refresh_deduped_listing()` after writing commands; `refresh-view`; `stats` compares mat vs live | **Approved.** The integration with C's 13 commits was verified: web, then pytest, then web, then e2e all passed on one DB. |
| `c2ed80f` | B16 review 4: geocode order rotates, only full-budget rows are charged | **Approved** |
| `d0e24c6` | **B13 matcher**: `scraper cluster`, plus a check for one clusterId per dedupKey | **CHANGES REQUESTED. Do not merge as is.** See below. |

**B13 matcher review findings (to fix before merging `d0e24c6`):**
1. *Major:* false positives chain. Two flats at one address, each reported by both sources, sold 2 days apart at prices within 0.5% get cross-matched and merged into one sale. On the 200k perf copy, 127 clusters merged two real sales.
   - Require `|ΔareaSqm| ≤ 1 m²` (or ≤ 2%) and `|Δrooms| ≤ 0.5` when both are known.
   - **Never** union components so that one cluster holds two different dedupKeys from the same source.
   - Process candidate pairs closest-first.
2. *Major:* clusters are never undone. A row re-scraped or reparsed to a different price stays merged and hides a sale. Either clear `clusterId` on upsert or reparse when `dedupKey` changes, or recompute all components each run (about 1.5 s at 200k rows) and write only the diffs.
3. *Minor:* `--dry-run` over-counts `rows_updated`.
4. *Minor:* a dedupKey split across clusters with no cross-source partner is never healed; seed the union-find from `dedup_keys_in_multiple_clusters()`.
5. *Nit:* translate both cases of åäöéè in the SQL key.

The reviewer's probe tests are in `docs/review-probes/b13_matcher_probe.py`. Copy it to `scraper/tests/`: tests 4–6 assert the buggy behaviour, so invert them as the failing-first tests.

The B46 refresh calls are **guarded**: they do nothing until the SQL function exists. That is why B merges before C.

### 2b. `handoff/c-data`: merge SECOND, right after B46

`0ab262e 14ae682 5e2ded6 7810ca4 4b4bfc8 a64fa4a cb6f630 01b4e94 0ebb0b7 04964a4 b1875a1 733bbbf 7bd12c2`

**All review-approved**, including `7bd12c2`, the B24 review fix (in-memory data cache via `isrFlushToDisk:false`, salt removed). Its re-review verified on a real server that there is no disk growth and that cache hits and revalidation work.

| Items | What |
|---|---|
| B21 | Reads come from the materialized view `"DedupedListingMat"`; the perf record is in `docs/perf.md` |
| B25 | Heatmap capped at 30k rows, with a `truncated` flag |
| B26 | `topMovers` uses medians and disjoint windows |
| B23 | `lib/text.ts` plus `shared/slug-vectors.json` |
| B24 | Tag-based caching plus `POST /api/revalidate` |

**Why the order matters:** after B21 the web app reads a *snapshot* that only changes when `refresh_deduped_listing()` runs. Without B46 the site would silently show stale data after a scrape.

### 2c. `handoff/e-analytics`: merge THIRD

`2ef182e 4257179 8a61a15 22a62cf 12d76ea 85fe265 c6d646c 5ab1bbf 4bd971d f07ca97 7627e4d`

**Reviewed: 3 commits need changes first.** The findings and probe tests are in `docs/review-probes/e-batch-review.md` and `e_batch_probe.spec.ts`. Add the fixes as new commits on the branch, re-review them, then merge the whole branch.

| Items | What |
|---|---|
| F32 + F27 | No horizontal page overflow on mobile |
| F20 (E part) | Mobile nav |
| F34 | Singular/plural copy |
| F13 UI + F31 | SQL summary cards |
| B14 UI | Median shown by default |
| F8 | Month/year toggle |
| F10 | Address, street and district series together |
| F11 + F12 | Time axis, n in tooltips, low-n buckets muted |
| F18 | Data freshness indicator |
| F28 + F29 | Recharts SSR warnings; copy fixes |

E branched from a `main` that did not yet have C's 2b commits (now merged). Expect small conflicts in pages that consume `aggregations.ts`. Resolve them, then run the gate.

### After the merges

`docs/backlog.md` already says what each item still needs. The direct follow-ups:

- **F35 (E):** the insights movers card and subtitle must match B26: last 90 days vs the prior 12 months, medians, recent/prior n.
- **B49 (B):** the scraper calls `POST $APP_URL/api/revalidate` with `Authorization: Bearer $REVALIDATE_SECRET` (16+ characters) after each refresh.
- **F16 (C then E):** add a `rooms?: number[]` parameter to `districtTimeseries`, `streetTimeseries`, `streetSummary` and `districtStreetCount`, where 5 means "5 or more". Then add the room chips to the district and street pages.
- **D adopts B23:** `StreetSearch` uses `foldForSearch`, `AddressDrawer` uses `slugifyStreet`. Also: the map UI hint for heatmap `truncated`, and `BrandMark compact` replacing D's CSS hack on `/`.
- **B51 (C):** the data cache bound is 50 MB of *serialised* payload, which can mean several hundred MB of heap with many tiny entries. Set an explicit smaller `cacheMaxMemorySize` (8–16 MB) and don't cache `streetFromSlug` misses.
- **B23 (Python):** assert `shared/slug-vectors.json` in pytest.
- **Update `CLAUDE.md`:**
  - new scraper modules: `source_base.py`, `crawl_state.py`, `lock.py`, `scrape_run.py`, `pagination.py`, `reparse.py`, `cluster` code;
  - commands: `backfill`, `reparse`, `cluster`, `refresh-view`, plus `--log-level` and `--max-pages`;
  - exit codes: 0 ok, 1 failure, 75 lock busy, rate-limited or unavailable, 78 bad Mapbox token;
  - the mat-view refresh rule and the data cache and revalidate flow.

## 3. How the work was run (keep doing it this way)

- **Roles and file ownership:** §6 of the original brief. In short:
  - B scraper owns `scraper/**`.
  - C data/API owns `web/prisma/**`, `web/src/lib/**` and `web/src/app/api/**`.
  - D map UI owns `web/src/app/page.tsx` and the map components under `web/src/components/map/**`.
  - E analytics UI owns the other pages and components.
  - R reviewer is read-only.
  - A single agent can play every role, one task at a time; ownership still decides which commits belong together.
- **The per-task loop** is in `docs/agent-brief.md`: failing test first, smallest fix, full `scripts/check.sh`, one commit per backlog ID.
- **The reviewer checklist** is in `docs/reviewer-brief.md`. Every review so far found real issues, so keep reviewing adversarially. The most important check: "does the test fail without the fix?"
- **Ledger:** `docs/backlog.md` is the single source of truth. `scripts/ledger.py` helps edit rows; its usage is in the file's docstring. Keep the "Orchestration state" section current so the next session can resume.

## 4. Practical notes and gotchas

- **Never kill processes you didn't start.** No `pkill next` or similar. Two e2e runs were broken this way.
- **Test databases.** Tests never touch the dev DB `bostadspriser`. Use `TEST_DB_NAME=bostadspriser_test_<something>`; the helpers refuse any name without `test` in it. When running work in parallel, give each runner its own `TEST_DB_NAME` and `E2E_PORT`.
- **macOS + Python 3.13:** `.pth` files flagged hidden are skipped. `scripts/check.sh` clears the flag, and pytest uses `pythonpath = ["src"]`.
- **`merge-seq.sh` on a gate failure.** The cherry-pick stays committed. Read the log it prints.
  - If the failure is infrastructure (port busy, a killed server, a flaky load-dependent timeout), re-run `scripts/check.sh` and continue with the remaining shas.
  - If the commit itself is at fault, `git reset --hard HEAD~1` and send it back for a fix.
- **Recharts 3.8.1 + React 19:** `isAnimationActive={false}` was reported to break client-side `<Link>` navigation on production builds. An e2e spec guards it; don't reintroduce it.
- **`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`** stalled intermittently under the test suite's TRUNCATE/refill churn, so plain REFRESH is used, with `lock_timeout 5s`.
- **Perf database:** `bostadspriser_test_c_perf` (about 200k synthetic rows) is reused by `pnpm perf`. Drop it when no longer needed.
- **Guardrails, unchanged:**
  - Never run the live scrapers against hemnet.se or booli.se.
  - No bot-protection circumvention, lower delays or more concurrency.
  - Never touch `scraper/.state/`, `scraper/.cache/` or `.env`.
  - No destructive SQL on the dev DB.

## 5. Remaining plan to the stop conditions

1. Merge §2a → §2b → §2c, reviewing whatever is unreviewed.
2. Finish the open P1 rows in `docs/backlog.md`: F9 compare builder, F16, F19 error and loading states, F35, B14 ingest bounds, B15, and the B16 follow-ups.
3. P2: F21 (E part), F22 design tokens, F23 SEO, B22 `streetSlug`, F36–F38 and so on. Phase 4 (P3, optional): B28 only with evidence, B29 Dockerfile + cron (treat exit 75 as "skip, alert if it persists"; 78 should alert), F24, F25, and optionally the Next 16 / Prisma 7 upgrade.
4. **Audit rounds.** A fresh reviewer audits the current code without seeing earlier diffs. Triage its findings into new IDs. Stop after **two consecutive** rounds that find no new P0/P1 issues.
5. Write `docs/REPORT.md` (format in the original brief §6 "Final report"). Test counts so far:

   | | Baseline | ~last measured |
   |---|---|---|
   | pytest | 39 | ~476 |
   | web vitest | 0 | ~400 |
   | Playwright e2e | 0 | ~210 |
